# R&D (Research & Documentation)

## Setup:

- **Dependencies**:
  - Discord.py, Python3, Python-dotenv packages
- **How to get API token**:
  - Discord Developer Portal -> Create Application/Bot/Server -> Get API token from Developer page.
- **Where to put it to work with the code**:
  - You have to create a .env file and put your tokens in.
  - Format: `DISCORD_TOKEN=token`, `DISCORD_GUILD=guild`

## Usage:

- **Commands**:
  - `catme` - gives you a picture of a cat.
  - `suntzu` - gives you a Suntzu quote.

## Research:

- After very diligent research, I have determined that the best way to keep a Discord bot running 24/7 is to put it on a server. Some options include putting it on a Raspberry Pi or on a VPS.
